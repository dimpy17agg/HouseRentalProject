 The bungalow is yet another and popular Indian house design. They are large homes used
  as a solitary family unit. You can see these types of houses in India in the urban spaces. The biggest advantage 
  of these types of houses in the area of space in and around your home that gives you enough room for a garden or even
   a stroll.<br/>
    As bungalows are one or one and a half stories, strategically planted trees and shrubs are usually
    sufficient to block the view of neighbors. With two-story houses, the extra height requires much 
     taller trees to accomplish the same, and it may not be practical to place such tall trees close
      to the building to obscure the view from the second floor of the next door neighbor. Bungalows provide
     cost-effective residences. On the other hand, even closely spaced bungalows make for quite low-density neighborhoods,
    contributing to urban sprawl. In Australia, bungalows have broad verandas to shade the interior from intense sun. 
    But as a result they are often excessively dark inside, requiring artificial light even in daytime.
